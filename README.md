This repo contains technical questions (and answers) on several topics you might want to prepare for an interview for BE position.

Most of the questions comes from [vietnakid](HTTPS://github.com/vietnakid/learning-material/blob/master/computer-science/cs_questions.md). I wrote down the brief answers and add some new questions/topics.

The answers to those questions are based on my humble knowledge. If you find something that you want to improve or fix, please fire a PR, I would be more than happy.
